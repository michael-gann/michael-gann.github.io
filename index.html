								<h2>I am a full stack software developer<br>
								(with a focus on the frontend)</h2>
								<p>I believe that creating responsive and intuitive websites is what makes all the work on the backend shine through for any web app. I am a curious and dedicated software developer who has experience building full-stack web apps in React (which is crazy powerful), Redux (so useful), and of course JavaScript (otherwise how would those work). I love learning and taking on challenges that allow me to grow as a developer and person. Getting lost (figuratively!) in a project is what I live for.
									I have two loving dogs and a cat (who thinks he's a dog).

								<h2><a href="https://buttery.herokuapp.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">buttery</a></h2>
								<p>Recipe & Pantry tracker - An app to keep track of your favorite recipes as well as your pantry’s stock that can generate a shopping list for you based on recipes you want to make, as well as update your pantry for recipes you mark as made. Future plans are to allow dynamic measurement units, ability to keep track of favorite recipes, and organize recipes by predefined/user created categories. This is a passion project. I love to bake, but I don't like creating a shopping list for the handful of recipes I plan to make in a weekend.</p>

								<h2><a href="https://splitease.herokuapp.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Splitease</a></h2>
								<p>Clone of Splitwise - Allows a user to split bills evenly with one or multiple friends. Provides transaction logs and account balances between friends to easily see how much money you owe, or are owed. Future plans involve allowing users to choose how to split a bill between users and to redesign the UI. I mimicked Splitwise' desktop site but they definitely focused their design efforts more on their mobile version.

								<p>Etsy clone. E-commerce website. A site that lists out pets and products to purchase in an easy to use platform. Users can only purchase one pet because... well, try to buy more than one and see what happens. Future plans for this project include a user page, the ability for users to manage and add items to the site, and creating a history of orders placed through the site.</p>

								<h2>My skills</h2>
								<p>Tech is the way of the future. If it’s not easy to use, it will only hinder our progress. I believe intuitive, clean, and responsive design is where every product should start and end. As developers, we should take hard to use out of the equation.</p>
