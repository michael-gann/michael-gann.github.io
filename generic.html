								<h3>Currently</h3>
								<p>I currently live in Salt Lake City, Utah. I am open to any opportunities you're hiring for and would love to talk about the impact I would have working on your team.
								I have recently graduated from App Academy, a six month immersive program that taught me the fundamentals of computer science and how to be a full stack developer. 
								Throughout that process I learned how to design, develop, and deploy full stack applications and how to learn any technology to accomplish a task. I know that I will be able to 
								hit the ground running at your company so please, reach out! I'm excited to get to know about your company!</p>

								<p>Besides coding, I love baking. Like.. too much. If you want some sweets or even just some good bread, I'm your guy.
								I also love gardening, and am excited to get back into it this spring! There's something about the slow nature of plants. Somehow from a small seed a four foot tall tomato plant is bearing fruit for you to eat.
								I imagine programs are like plants. They start out small, just a blank document. Like a seed in soil. After some time and care it sprawls for hundres of lines and produces.. well pretty much whatever you want.
								Too bad seeds don't do that. But maybe we could make them...</p>

								<h4>Previous Career</h4>
								<p>I worked in construction as a Production Manager for a foundation repair company from 2016-2020.</p>
								
								<p> While there I worked across many teams to improve the company culture and our bottom-line. Getting things done 
								required knowing who to talk to to get something done you can't get done alone. I learned how to reach out and work collaboritvely with people
								to achieve a common goal. It was a fast paced environment where I was in charge of over 30 projects a week and had to be in contact with customers and 
								teams to keep everything running smoothly, especially the production crews.
